SF-DynFinGC: Learning Scale-Free Dynamic Graphs for Financial Anomaly Detection

Financial anomaly detection (FAD) is a critical task for economic security. Graph-based methods for FAD are promising, but their effectiveness is determined by graph construction, a critical yet overlooked foundation. However, the reliance on either static or overly simplistic dynamic models renders current construction strategies inadequate. These strategies are often computationally expensive and incapable of modeling complex spatio-temporal relationships. To overcome these challenges, we propose Scale-Free Dynamic Financial Graph Construction (SF-DynFinGC). The framework integrates scale-free structural regularization with a decay-governed global Top-k edge selection strategy to construct sparse, interpretable graphs that highlight critical relationships indicative of anomalies. Experiments demonstrate that SF-DynFinGC consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks. Visualization analysis further confirms the framework's ability to capture hierarchical and dispersed characteristics of real-world financial networks. This work establishes a robust foundation for domain-aware spatio-temporal graph learning, advancing its application in financial risk management.
